![Ionic React E-Commerce App](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/355272810/25392780-9707-11eb-95b2-bb9c6eefd313)

### Included in this Ionic React Template/UI
* Utilising Ionic CSS variables
* API fetch (dummy JSON)
* Examples of how stock components look
* 6 example themes to demonstrate
* Low-code

Note: I haven't overridden all available Ionic CSS variables, just some to demonstrate and some of the core, visually noticeable ones.

### To run

```javascript
npm install
ionic serve
```

Alternatively, you can add the iOS, Android platform and run natively.
